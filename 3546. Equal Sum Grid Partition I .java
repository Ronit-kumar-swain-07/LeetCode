/*
3546. Equal Sum Grid Partition I

You are given an m x n matrix grid of positive integers. 
Your task is to determine if it is possible to make either one horizontal or one vertical cut on the grid such that:
Each of the two resulting sections formed by the cut is non-empty.
The sum of the elements in both sections is equal.
Return true if such a partition exists; otherwise return false.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,4],[2,3]]
Output: true
Explanation:
A horizontal cut between row 0 and row 1 results in two non-empty sections, each with a sum of 5. Thus, the answer is true.

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: false
Explanation:
No horizontal or vertical cut results in two non-empty sections with equal sums. Thus, the answer is false.

Constraints:

1 <= m == grid.length <= 105
1 <= n == grid[i].length <= 105
2 <= m * n <= 105
1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105
